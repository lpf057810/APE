# Project Title

This repository contains the code and resources for my project. Below are the details of each file:

### Files Included

1. **`database - cleaned - final.ipynb`**  
   This notebook contains the data cleaning and preprocessing steps performed on the raw dataset. It includes handling missing values, feature engineering, and data transformation to prepare the dataset for analysis and modeling.

2. **`model - Final.ipynb`**  
   This notebook implements the machine learning model. It includes feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation metrics. The final trained model is also stored for further use.

3. **`VIF.ipynb`**  
   This notebook calculates the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to check for multicollinearity among the features. It ensures the robustness and reliability of the selected predictors in the modeling process.
